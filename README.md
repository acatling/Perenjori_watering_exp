## README
Repository for WA Perenjori Watering Experiment\
PhD Research\
Experiment conducted in 2020\
Paper 'variation in demographic responses to competition and abiotic conditions in an annual plant community' preprint 2023\

NOTE: I will create a new repository containing only necessary data, script and outputs needed to reproduce data in the paper. \
For now, the relevant scripts are only:\
data_preparation.R\
data_preparation sheet contains all script needed to clean data and generate dataframes for analysis\
demography_paper_figs_tables.R\
demography_paper_figs_tables contains script needed to generate results, figures and tables\
functions.R \
functions sheet contains functions needed to run code in other sheets\

vitaldata and popdata are the dataframes containing cleaned vital rates and population growth rates respectively with 
a row per individual with Species, Site, Plot, neighbour abundance, survival, abiotic environment info, trait data
